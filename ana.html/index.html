            <h2>My Favourite Characters</h2>

            <h3>1. Ironman</h3>
            <img src="photos/ironman.jpg" style="width:25%;"
                alt="Iron Man in a battle-damaged suit, kneeling on a rock in the ocean with several other Iron Man suits flying in the Background.">
            <p>Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, is the genius inventor who built the armored suit that made him a
                hero. His intelligence, humor, and bravery make him one of the most important Avengers.</p>
            <h3>2. Captain America</h3>
            <img src="photos/CAP.jpg" style="width:25%;"
                alt="A dramatic shot of Captain America looking down, holding his shield with both hands in a gritty, battle-worn setting.">
            <p>Steve Rogers, the first Avenger, is known as Captain America. With his super-soldier strength and
                unshakable morals, he became a symbol of hope and leadership for the Avengers.</p>
            <h3>3. The Incredible Hulk</h3>
            <img src="photos/hulk.jpg" style="width:45%;"
                alt="The Incredible Hulk roaring in anger in the middle of a city, with crashing airplanes and rubble around him.">
            <p>Dr. Bruce Banner transforms into the Hulk when angry. While often misunderstood, Hulk’s unmatched
                strength and loyalty make him a valuable member of the Avengers.</p>
            <h3>4. Thor (God of Thunder)</h3>
            <img src="photos/thor.jpg" style="width:45%;"
                alt="Thor standing in his Asgardian armor with a serious expression, holding his hammer, Mjolnir.">
            <p>Thor, the God of Thunder, comes from Asgard. With his hammer Mjolnir and control over lightning, he
                brings power, courage, and a touch of humor to the Avengers team.</p>
            <h3>5. Spider-Man</h3>
            <img src="photos/spidy.jpg" style="width:25%;"
                alt="Spider-Man crouching in his suit while holding Captain America's shield.">
            <p>Peter Parker, also known as Spider-Man, is the youngest Avenger. With his quick reflexes, web-shooting
                abilities, and heart for doing good, he brings youthful energy and courage to the team.</p>

            <h2>My Favourite Movies</h2>
            <h3>1. The Avengers (2012)</h3>
            <img src="photos/The-Avengers-(2012).jpg" style="width:40%;"
                alt="Movie poster for Marvel's The Avengers (2012), featuring the original six members: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, along with Nick Fury and Bruce Banner.">
            <p>This film was the true birth of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it. For the first time, heroes
                from individual movies came together, testing whether such a crossover could succeed. <br> the battles
                with Loki and the Chitauri invasion, the story highlighted clashing personalities, Tony Stark’s
                arrogance, Steve Rogers’ discipline, and Bruce Banner’s struggle with his inner monster. The movie
                redefined superhero storytelling by proving teamwork could shine as brightly as any single hero.</p>
            <h3>2. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)</h3>
            <img src="photos/Avengers-AoU.jpg" style="width:25%;"
                alt="Movie poster for Marvel Studios' Avengers: Age of Ultron, showing the team in a dynamic battle pose against a horde of Ultron robots.">
            <p>Age of Ultron explored the dangers of unchecked ambition when Tony Stark’s plan for “a suit of armor
                around the world” gave birth to Ultron. <br>Unlike the first film, the Avengers fought not just an
                external villain but the consequences of their own actions. It was darker, more complex, and introduced
                key players like Wanda Maximoff and Vision. The movie planted seeds of mistrust within the team, while
                also showing the growing cost of being Earth’s protectors.</p>
            <h3>3. Avengers: Infinity War (2018)</h3>
            <img src="photos/Avenger-Infinity-War-(2018).jpg" style="width:25%;"
                alt="Movie poster for Marvel Studios' Avengers: Infinity War, featuring the main cast of heroes and the villain Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet.">
            <p>Infinity War shattered the idea that the heroes would always win. With Thanos at the center, the movie
                balanced dozens of characters while giving real weight to the villain’s motives. For the first time, the
                Avengers weren’t in control — they were reacting, scrambling, and falling short at every turn. The
                emotional punches hit hard: Gamora’s sacrifice, Vision’s death, and finally, the snap that erased half
                the universe. It was a cliffhanger that left fans stunned worldwide.</p>
            <h3>4. Avengers: Endgame (2019)</h3>
            <img src="photos/End-Game.jpg" style="width:25%;"
                alt="Movie poster for Marvel Studios' Avengers: Endgame, featuring portraits of the surviving heroes like Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor.">
            <p>Endgame wasn’t just a movie; it was a cultural event. The three-hour epic served as both a love letter
                and a farewell to over a decade of interconnected stories. From the quiet grief in the first act to the
                time-travel adventure through past MCU highlights, the film balanced nostalgia with fresh drama. <br>The
                climactic final battle, where portals opened and heroes assembled, delivered one of the most iconic
                moments in film history. Sacrifices by Iron Man and Black Widow gave the saga emotional closure,
                reminding audiences that heroism often comes at the highest cost.</p>
            <h3>5. Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)</h3>
            <img src="photos/Captain-America-The First-Avenger-2011.webp" style="width:25%;"
                alt="Movie poster for Marvel Studios' Captain America: The First Avenger, showing Captain America in his original suit holding his shield, with other characters behind him.">
            <p>Unlike the flashier heroes, Steve Rogers began as a frail young man with nothing but determination. His
                transformation into Captain America was less about super-soldier serum and more about his unshakable
                moral compass. <br>The film grounded the MCU in history, weaving superhero storytelling into World War
                II drama. Steve’s romance with Peggy Carter and his self-sacrifice against Red Skull showed why he
                became the moral anchor of the Avengers. His journey began here, not as a soldier with power, but as a
                man who refused to Back down.</p>

            <h2>MCU Phases</h2>
            <h3>Phase 1</h3>
            <img src="photos/phase-1.jpg" style="width:30%;"
                alt="Promotional art for Marvel's Phase 1, depicting the original Avengers team battling in a destroyed city, with Iron Man front and center.">
            <p>Phase One is where it all began. This was the foundation of the MCU, giving us the first look at Iron
                Man, Captain America, Thor, and Hulk. Each hero had their own story, but it all led to the legendary
                moment when they assembled as the Avengers for the very first time. It was the spark that changed
                superhero movies forever.</p>
            <h3>Phase 2</h3>
            <img src="photos/Phase-2.avif" style="width:25%;"
                alt="Promotional image for Marvel Studios' Cinematic Universe Phase Two, featuring key characters like Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Star-Lord, and Ultron.">
            <p>In Phase Two, the stories grew bigger, deeper, and darker. Iron Man dealt with his inner struggles,
                Captain America uncovered hidden secrets, and Thor faced cosmic threats. New heroes like the Guardians
                of the Galaxy joined in, adding humor and heart to the universe. The phase ended with Ultron’s rise,
                testing the Avengers’ strength as a team.</p>
            <h3>Phase 3</h3>
            <img src="photos/phase-3.jpg" style="width:25%;"
                alt="Promotional image for Captain America: Civil War, showing two teams of heroes facing off against each other with Captain America's shield in the middle.">
            <p>Phase Three was the heart of the MCU’s epic saga. Friendships broke in Civil War, kingdoms rose in Black
                Panther, and the multiverse began to open through Doctor Strange. Spider-Man swung into the universe,
                and the Avengers faced their greatest challenge in Infinity War and Endgame — battles that defined
                sacrifice, loss, and triumph. This phase became the emotional peak of the MCU.</p>
            <h3>Phase 4</h3>
            <img src="photos/Phase-4.webp" style="width:25%;"
                alt="A collage of heroes from Marvel's Phase 4, with Scarlet Witch in the center surrounded by characters like Doctor Strange, Thor, Ms. Marvel, and Moon Knight.">
            <p>Phase Four marked a fresh start after Endgame. Old heroes passed the torch, and new ones stepped up, like
                Shang-Chi, the Eternals, and the next generation of Avengers. Disney+ series like WandaVision and Loki
                expanded the universe in surprising ways, showing us grief, growth, and the dangers of the multiverse.
                It was a phase of rebuilding and discovery.</p>
            <h3>Phase 5</h3>
            <img src="photos/phase-5.jpg" style="width:25%;"
                alt="A collage of Marvel heroes for Phase 5, including Captain Marvel, Deadpool, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, and Black Panther, with the Avengers logo in the center.">
            <p>Phase Five pushes the story forward into even stranger and riskier territory. The multiverse is no longer
                just an idea — it’s here, with Kang and new villains raising the stakes. Familiar faces like Ant-Man and
                the Guardians return, while the stage is being set for the next Avengers. This phase is about what comes
                after rebuilding: preparing for something even bigger.</p>
